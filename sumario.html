  <h1>Top 4 melhores m√∫sicas da Lana del Rey</h1>
  <h2>Sad girl</h2>
  <p> "But you haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen my man (man, man)
You haven't seen my man (man)
You haven't seen him (woah-oh)
He's got the fire
And he walks with it
He's got the fire
And he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl"
</p>
  <h2>Shades of cool</h2>
  <p> "My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable"</p>
  <h2>Pretty when you cry</h2>
  <p> "All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world
I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe, you never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
"</p>
  <h2>Art deco</h2>
  <p>" Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you just want to be seen
Want to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the likes
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gun metal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto
You're looking to score
When they all say hello
You try to ignore them
'Cause you want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
'Cause you want more
"</p>
